This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(sf)
# change this to your file path!!!
shape <- st_read("~/Documents/_UCL_grad school/UCL/Term 1 /GIS CASA/casa_0005_coursework/week 1/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp")


```
```{r}
summary(shape)
plot(shape)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(sf)
shape %>% 
  st_geometry() %>%
  plot()
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#this needs to be your file path again
mycsv <-  read_csv("~/Documents/_UCL_grad school/UCL/Term 1 /GIS CASA/casa_0005_coursework/week 1/fly_tipping_borough_pivot.csv", skip = 1)  

```

```{r}
shape <- shape%>%
  merge(.,
        mycsv,
        by.x="GSS_CODE", 
        by.y="Row Labels")
```

```{r}
## yay made a map!! 
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("plot")
# change the fill to your column name if different
shape %>%
  qtm(.,fill = "2011-12")
```
